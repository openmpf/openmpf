# Overview

Welcome to the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) core project!

For more information, including documentation, guides, and other material, please visit our website at:
https://openmpf.github.io/

This repository contains source code for the OpenMPF core, including the majority of the back-end and front-end code. Components (the code that performs the actual processing) can be found in other repositories under https://github.com/openmpf/.

For a latest snapshot of what tasks are being worked on, what's available to pick up, and where we stand as a whole, check out our workboard @ https://overv.io/~/openmpf/.

The OpenMPF core repository is divided into various maven modules, including the
node manager, which controls the OpenMPF services running on a given node, and the
workflow manager, which is the web application server that manages routing messages and jobs.

*NOTE: The Media Processing Framework (MPF) project has been renamed to OpenMPF, but not all documentation and other artifacts have yet updated to reflect the change.*
