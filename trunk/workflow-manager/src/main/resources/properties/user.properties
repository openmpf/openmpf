# When the Workflow Manager starts, it will check the persistent database for the users specified in this file.
# If a user does not exist in the database, it will be added. Note that if the user role or password is different in
# the database, that will take precedence over the information in this file.

# Passwords are encoded using bcrypt. Here are two ways you can encode a password:
#
# 1. Use Docker:
#    docker run --rm epicsoft/bcrypt hash <raw-password> 12
#
# 2. Use the OpenMPF password generator tool:
#    https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/blob/master/trunk/mpf-password-generator/README.md

# Here's an example of an encoded password: $2a$12$PnqXmowXmFErAKYdP68l7esPXVkOpDnRoSMlqPwBj4qfEeIBlvqDC
# The first two fields are delimited by "$":
#   2a is the bcrypt algorithm version used
#   12 is the encoding strength (log rounds used)
# The last part is the salt and cipher text concatenated and encoded in a modified Base-64.

# Authentication is performed by the Spring security framework, which uses bcrypt to salt and hash what the user
# provides as a password during login, and compares the result to the encoded password in the persistent database.

# Format: <name>=<role>,<encoded-password>
# Use "user" for the non-admin role, "admin" for the admin role.
# User names cannot contain whitespace.
