Can be set to “NONE”, “FRAME”, or “SUPERSET_REGION”. If set to “NONE”, the default segmenting behavior is used. If set to “FRAME” or “SUPERSET_REGION”, then the segment length properties are ignored and instead this algorithm will process one segment per track generated in the previous stage. If set to “FRAME”, then this algorithm will ignore the regions associated with previous detections and instead process the entire frame associated with each of those detections. If set to “SUPERSET_REGION”, then this algorithm will generate a superset region for each of the previous tracks – a bounding box of constant size and position that encloses all of the track’s detection regions.
