            <pre>
The licences which components of this software fall under are as
follows.  First, we will summarize and say that all components
are under a BSD licence, or a licence more free than that.

OpenSSH contains no GPL code.

1)
     * Copyright (c) 1995 Tatu Ylonen &lt;ylo@cs.hut.fi&gt;, Espoo, Finland
     *                    All rights reserved
     *
     * As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
     * can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
     * software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
     * incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
     * called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

    [Tatu continues]
     *  However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or
     * copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that
     * are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included
     * source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements
     * and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most
     * restrictive); see below for details.

    [However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time.  All of
    these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about
    have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,

     - RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library
     - IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated
     - DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library
     - GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL
     - Zlib is now external, in a library
     - The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included
     - TSS has been removed
     - MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library
     - RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL
     - Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library

    [The licence continues]

    Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
    software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
    bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.  More
    information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".

    The legal status of this program is some combination of all these
    permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
    You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
    making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in
    your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.


                            NO WARRANTY

    BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    One component of the ssh source code is under a 3-clause BSD license,

    OVERVIEW
    ========

    This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
    and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
    method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG's strong suit is compressing
    photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and
    brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or
    other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG
    quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such
    images.

    JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to
    the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other "smooth" images,
    very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression
    artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are
    willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the "quality" setting in the
    compressor.)

    This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
    compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
    processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
    We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless
    processes defined in the standard.

    We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
    plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
    perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
    The library is intended to be reused in other applications.

    In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
    considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
    for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
    decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
    colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
    library if not required for a particular application.

    We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between
    different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple
    applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.

    The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
    flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
    the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
    REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
    be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
    achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.

    We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
    No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
    documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.


    LEGAL ISSUES
    ============

    In plain English:

    1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
       please let us know!)
    2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
    3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
       program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
       you've used the IJG code.

    In legalese:

    The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
    with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
    fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
    its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

    Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
    software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
    conditions:
    (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
    README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
    unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
    must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
    (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
    documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
    the Independent JPEG Group".
    (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
    full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
    NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

    These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
    not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
    acknowledge us.

    Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
    in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
    it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
    software".

    We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
    commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
    assumed by the product vendor.


    The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
    It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
    The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
    ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
    but is also freely distributable.

    The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
    To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
    support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
    to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
    algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
    by all standard GIF decoders.

    We are required to state that
        "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
        CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
        CompuServe Incorporated."


    REFERENCES
    ==========

    We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
    understand the innards of the JPEG software.

    The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
        Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
        Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
    (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
    applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
    handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
    available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually
    a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
    omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
    and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
    and it may not be used for commercial purposes.

    A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
    "The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
    M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
    good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
    including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
    code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
    sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
    at a full implementation, you've got one here...

    The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still
    Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.
    Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.
    Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG
    standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).

    The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual
    specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is
    titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
    Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
    10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
    Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
    numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.

    The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
    format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
    1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report
    and thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free
    download in PDF format from
    http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm.
    A PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at
    http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at
    http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.

    The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
    ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
    found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
    IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
    Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
    (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from
    http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision
    of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
    Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
    uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.


    ARCHIVE LOCATIONS
    =================

    The "official" archive site for this software is www.ijg.org.
    The most recent released version can always be found there in
    directory "files".

    The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a source of some
    general information about JPEG.
    It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/
    and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers
    archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.
    If you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
    with body
        send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1
        send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2


    FILE FORMAT WARS
    ================

    The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (also known as JPEG, together
    with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name
    "JPEG" which are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG.  IJG therefore does
    not support these formats (see REFERENCES).  Indeed, one of the original
    reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on
    common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.
    Don't use an incompatible file format!
    (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG
    image files indefinitely.)

            <h3>GNU General Public License Version 2</h3>

            <p>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>

            <p>Version 2, June 1991</p>

            <p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA
                02110-1301, USA</p>

            <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
                allowed. Preamble</p>

            <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
                the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
                make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
                Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
                Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it
                to your programs, too.</p>

            <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
                designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
                service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
                software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>

            <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask
                you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>

            <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
                recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
                code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

            <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives
                you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>

            <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is
                no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
                recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will
                not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>

            <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
                redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
                proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
                or not licensed at all.</p>

            <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>

            <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>

            <p>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
                saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
                refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or
                any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
                included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>

            <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
                outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
                covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
                running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>

            <p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
                provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
                disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
                warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

            <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
                protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

            <p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
                Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
                that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

            <p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the
                date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part
                contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
                third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands
                interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
                ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
                that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
                program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the
                Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
                Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
                If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
                independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
                whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
                License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
                regardless of who wrote it.</p>

            <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
                you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
                works based on the Program.</p>

            <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based
                on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
                scope of this License.</p>

            <p>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or
                executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
                following:</p>

            <p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
                the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany
                it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
                your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
                corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
                offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
                distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
                accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
                modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules
                it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
                and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
                include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
                (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                itself accompanies the executable.</p>

            <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
                offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
                code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

            <p>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this
                License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
                automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
                rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain
                in full compliance.</p>

            <p>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants
                you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
                law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
                based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
                conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>

            <p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically
                receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
                terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
                granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>

            <p>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
                limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
                that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
                If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
                pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a
                patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
                directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>

            <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
                balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                circumstances.</p>

            <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or
                to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
                free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
                generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
                consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
                distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>

            <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
                License.</p>

            <p>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
                copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
                explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
                only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
                written in the body of this License.</p>

            <p>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from
                time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
                to address new problems or concerns.</p>

            <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this
                License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms
                and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
                the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
                the Free Software Foundation.</p>

            <p>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions
                are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
                decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
                software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

            <p>NO WARRANTY</p>

            <p>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
                PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
                PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
                INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
                PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

            <p>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
                OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
                USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
                SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
                SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

            <h3>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
            <p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

            <p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                &lt;<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p><p>
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

            <h3> Preamble </h3>

            <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
                software and other kinds of works.</p>

            <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
                to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
                the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
                share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
                software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
                GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
                any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
                your programs, too.</p>

            <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
                want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
                free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

            <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
                these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
                certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
                you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

            <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
                freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
                or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
                know their rights.</p>

            <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
                (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
                giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

            <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
                that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
                authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
                changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
                authors of previous versions.</p>

            <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
                modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
                can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
                protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
                pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
                use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
                have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
                products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
                stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
                of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

            <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
                States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
                software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
                avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
                make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
                patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

            <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                modification follow.</p>

            <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

            <h4>0. Definitions.</h4>

            <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
                works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
                License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
                &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</p>

            <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
                in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
                exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the
                earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>

            <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
                on the Program.</p>

            <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
                permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
                infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
                computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
                distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
                public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

            <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
                parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
                a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

            <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo;
                to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
                feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
                tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
                extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
                work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
                the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
                menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

            <h4>1. Source Code.</h4>

            <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work
                for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source
                form of a work.</p>

            <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
                standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
                interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
                is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

            <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
                than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
                packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
                Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
                Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
                implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
                &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
                (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
                (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
                produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

            <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
                the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
                work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
                control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
                System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
                programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
                which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
                includes interface definition files associated with source files for
                the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
                linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
                such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
                subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

            <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
                can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
                Source.</p>

            <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
                same work.</p>

            <h4>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

            <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
                copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
                conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
                permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
                covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
                content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
                rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

            <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
                convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
                in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
                of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
                with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
                the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
                not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
                for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
                and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
                your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

            <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
                the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
                makes it unnecessary.</p>

            <h4>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>

            <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
                measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
                11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
                similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
                measures.</p>

            <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
                circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
                is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
                the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
                modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
                users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
                technological measures.</p>

            <h4>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

            <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
                receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
                appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
                keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
                non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
                keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
                recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

            <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
                and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

            <h4>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

            <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
                produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
                terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
                    it, and giving a relevant date.</li>

                <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
                    released under this License and any conditions added under section
                    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
                    &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</li>

                <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
                    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
                    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
                    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
                    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
                    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
                    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

                <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
                    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
                    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
                    work need not make them do so.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
                works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
                and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
                in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
                &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
                used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
                beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
                in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
                parts of the aggregate.</p>

            <h4>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>

            <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
                of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
                machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
                in one of these ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
                    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
                    customarily used for software interchange.</li>

                <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
                    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
                    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
                    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
                    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
                    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
                    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
                    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
                    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
                    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
                    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>

                <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
                    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
                    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
                    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
                    with subsection 6b.</li>

                <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
                    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
                    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
                    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
                    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
                    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
                    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
                    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
                    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
                    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
                    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
                    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

                <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
                    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
                    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
                    charge under subsection 6d.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
                from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
                included in conveying the object code work.</p>

            <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
                tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
                or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
                into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
                doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
                product received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a
                typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
                of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
                actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
                is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
                commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
                the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
                procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
                and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
                a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
                suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
                code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
                modification has been made.</p>

            <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
                specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
                part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
                User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
                fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
                Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
                by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
                if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
                modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
                been installed in ROM).</p>

            <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
                requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
                for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
                the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
                network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
                adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
                protocols for communication across the network.</p>

            <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
                in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
                documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
                source code form), and must require no special password or key for
                unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

            <h4>7. Additional Terms.</h4>

            <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
                License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
                Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
                be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
                that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
                apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
                under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
                this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

            <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
                remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
                it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
                removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
                additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
                for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
                add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
                that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
                    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

                <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
                    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
                    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>

                <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
                    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
                    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>

                <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
                    authors of the material; or</li>

                <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
                    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

                <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
                    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
                    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
                    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
                    those licensors and authors.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
                restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
                received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
                governed by this License along with a term that is a further
                restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
                a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
                License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
                of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
                not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>

            <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
                must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
                additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
                where to find the applicable terms.</p>

            <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
                form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
                the above requirements apply either way.</p>

            <h4>8. Termination.</h4>

            <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
                provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
                modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
                this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
                paragraph of section 11).</p>

            <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
                license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
                provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
                finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
                holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
                prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

            <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
                reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
                violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
                received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
                copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
                your receipt of the notice.</p>

            <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
                licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
                this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
                reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
                material under section 10.</p>

            <h4>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>

            <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
                run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
                occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
                to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
                nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
                modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
                not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
                covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

            <h4>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>

            <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
                receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
                propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
                for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

            <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
                organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
                organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
                work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
                transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
                licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
                give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
                Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
                the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

            <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
                rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
                not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
                rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
                (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
                any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
                sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

            <h4>11. Patents.</h4>

            <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
                License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
                work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims
                owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
                hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
                by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
                but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
                consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
                purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
                patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
                this License.</p>

            <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
                patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
                make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
                propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

            <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
                agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
                (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
                sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
                party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
                patent against the party.</p>

            <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
                and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
                to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
                publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
                then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
                available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
                patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
                consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
                license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
                actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
                covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
                in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
                country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>

            <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
                arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
                covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
                receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
                or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
                you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
                work and works based on it.</p>

            <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within
                the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
                conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
                specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
                work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
                in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
                to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
                the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
                parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
                patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
                conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
                for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
                contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
                or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

            <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
                any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
                otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

            <h4>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

            <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
                covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
                not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
                to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
                the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
                License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

            <h4>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h4>

            <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
                permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
                under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
                combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
                License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
                but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
                section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
                combination as such.</p>

            <h4>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

            <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
                the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                address new problems or concerns.</p>

            <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
                Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
                Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the
                option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
                version or of any later version published by the Free Software
                Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
                GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
                by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

            <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
                versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
                public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
                to choose that version for the Program.</p>

            <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
                permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
                author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
                later version.</p>

            <h4>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>

            <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
                APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
                HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY
                OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
                THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
                IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
                ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

            <h4>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>

            <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
                THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
                GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
                USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
                DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
                PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
                EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
                SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

            <h4>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>

            <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
                above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
                reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
                an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
                Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
                copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

            <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

            <h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

            <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
                possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
                free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

            <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
                to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
                the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

            <pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
    </pre>

            <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

            <p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
                notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

            <pre>    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    </pre>

            <p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
                parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
                might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
                if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary.

            <p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
                into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
                may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
                the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
                Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

            <h3>GNU Lesser General Public License</h3>

            <p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>

            <p>Version 2.1, February 1999</p>

            <p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA
                02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
                changing it is not allowed.</p>

            <p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library
                Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble</p>

            <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
                the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
                make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>

            <p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software
                packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
                can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General
                Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>

            <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses
                are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
                the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
                things.</p>

            <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to
                ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>

            <p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
                recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
                code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
                that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you
                must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

            <p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this
                license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>

            <p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.
                Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
                have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems
                that might be introduced by others.</p>

            <p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure
                that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license
                from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library
                must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>

            <p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This
                license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite
                different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to
                permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.</p>

            <p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the
                two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public
                License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The
                Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</p>

            <p>We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's
                freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an
                advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
                Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special
                circumstances.</p>

            <p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain
                library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use
                the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
                libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we
                use the Lesser General Public License.</p>

            <p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of
                people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
                programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
                GNU/Linux operating system.</p>

            <p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the
                user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
                using a modified version of the Library.</p>

            <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to
                the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.
                The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in
                order to run.</p>

            <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>

            <p>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by
                the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser
                General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as
                &quot;you&quot;.</p>

            <p>A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently
                linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>

            <p>The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under
                these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
                copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
                modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
                included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</p>

            <p>&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a
                library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
                interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
                library.</p>

            <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
                outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
                program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
                the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the
                program that uses the Library does.</p>

            <p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in
                any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
                notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence
                of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.</p>

            <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
                protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

            <p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
                Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
                that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

            <p>a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry
                prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole
                of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a
                facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application
                program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must
                make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table,
                the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a
                function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this
                function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still
                compute square roots.)</p>

            <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
                derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
                then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.
                But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
                distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
                to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

            <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
                you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
                works based on the Library.</p>

            <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based
                on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
                scope of this License.</p>

            <p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a
                given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
                they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer
                version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that
                version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.</p>

            <p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General
                Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>

            <p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a
                library.</p>

            <p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code
                or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
                complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
                and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>

            <p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
                equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
                source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

            <p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the
                Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a
                work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
                License.</p>

            <p>However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a
                derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses
                the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for
                distribution of such executables.</p>

            <p>When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library,
                the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
                Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work
                is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>

            <p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros
                and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,
                regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
                portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>

            <p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under
                the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they
                are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>

            <p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;
                with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
                of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and
                reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>

            <p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library
                and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
                execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
                well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these
                things:</p>

            <p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including
                whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
                work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the
                Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
                produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes
                the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
                to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
                suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's
                computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly
                with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
                interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written
                offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
                above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is
                made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
                materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
                that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that
                uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
                it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
                normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
                on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
                executable.</p>

            <p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that
                do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
                Library together in an executable that you distribute.</p>

            <p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library
                together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
                provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities
                is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>

            <p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any
                other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent
                notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
                where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense,
                link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
                to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
                your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
                License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>

            <p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants
                you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
                law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
                based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
                conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.</p>

            <p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically
                receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject
                to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
                the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
                License.</p>

            <p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason
                (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
                this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
                and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For
                example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
                receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
                License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>

            <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
                balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                circumstances.</p>

            <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or
                to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
                free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
                generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
                consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
                distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>

            <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
                License.</p>

            <p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
                copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
                explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
                only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
                written in the body of this License.</p>

            <p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License
                from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
                detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

            <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this
                License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms
                and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
                the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
                Software Foundation.</p>

            <p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions
                are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
                the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
                Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
                software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

            <p>NO WARRANTY</p>

            <p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT
                PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
                PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
                INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
                PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

            <p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
                OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
                USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
                SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
                SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

            <p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                &lt;<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p><p>
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

            <p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
                the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
                License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

            <h4>0. Additional Definitions.</h4>

            <p>As used herein, &ldquo;this License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
                General Public License, and the &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU
                General Public License.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
                other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

            <p>An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
                by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
                Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
                of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

            <p>A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an
                Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
                with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked
                Version&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
                Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
                for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
                based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

            <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
                object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
                and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
                Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

            <h4>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h4>

            <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
                without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

            <h4>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h4>

            <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
                facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
                that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
                facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
                version:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
                    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
                    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
                    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</li>

                <li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
                    this License applicable to that copy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h4>

            <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
                a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
                code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
                material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
                layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
                (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
                    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
                    covered by this License.</li>

                <li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
                    document.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Combined Works.</h4>

            <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
                taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
                portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
                engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
                the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
                    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
                    covered by this License.</li>

                <li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
                    document.</li>

                <li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
                    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
                    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
                    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</li>

                <li>d) Do one of the following:

                    <ul>
                        <li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
                            License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
                            suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
                            recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
                            the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
                            manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
                            Corresponding Source.</li>

                        <li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                            Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
                            a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
                            system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
                            of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
                            Version.</li>
                    </ul></li>

                <li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
                    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
                    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
                    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
                    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
                    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
                    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
                    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
                    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
                    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
                    for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Combined Libraries.</h4>

            <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
                Library side by side in a single library together with other library
                facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
                License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
                choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
                    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
                    conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>

                <li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
                    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
                    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h4>

            <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
                versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
                differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

            <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
                Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
                of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo;
                applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
                conditions either of that published version or of any later version
                published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
                received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
                General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
                General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

            <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
                whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
                apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
                permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
                Library.</p>

            <h3>GNU Affero General Public License</h3>

            <p>GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>

            <p>Version 3, 19 November 2007</p>

            <p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a> Everyone
                is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
                allowed.</p>

            <p>Preamble</p>

            <p>The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works,
                specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</p>

            <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and
                change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
                and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.</p>

            <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
                designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
                if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
                use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

            <p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on
                the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
                modify the software.</p>

            <p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the
                program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many
                developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case
                of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License
                permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
                source code to the public.</p>

            <p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified
                source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the
                source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a
                modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the
                modified version.</p>

            <p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to
                accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
                released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.</p>

            <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>

            <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

            <p>0. Definitions. &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.</p>

            <p>&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as
                semiconductor masks.</p>

            <p>&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is
                addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or
                organizations.</p>

            <p>To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring
                copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &quot;modified
                version&quot; of the earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</p>

            <p>A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.</p>

            <p>To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you
                directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
                computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
                modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

            <p>To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive
                copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
                conveying.</p>

            <p>An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot; to the extent that it includes a
                convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
                the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that
                licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
                presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
                criterion.</p>

            <p>1. Source Code. The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
                modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source form of a work.</p>

            <p>A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a
                recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
                one that is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

            <p>The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that
                (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
                Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a
                Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A &quot;Major
                Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
                the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the
                work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

            <p>The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to
                generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including
                scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
                general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those
                activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
                definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and
                dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
                communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

            <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts
                of the Corresponding Source.</p>

            <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>

            <p>2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the
                Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your
                unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by
                this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges
                your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

            <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your
                license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
                them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
                provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
                control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
                behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
                copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

            <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
                is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.</p>

            <p>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an
                effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
                copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
                such measures.</p>

            <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures
                to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
                covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
                enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
                technological measures.</p>

            <p>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,
                in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in
                accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give
                all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

            <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
                protection for a fee.</p>

            <p>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
                produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also
                meet all of these conditions:</p>

            <p>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The
                work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added
                under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
                c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a
                copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
                of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to
                license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
                received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;
                however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
                need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which
                are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a
                larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if
                the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
                compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate
                does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</p>

            <p>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
                4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
                License, in one of these ways:</p>

            <p>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium),
                accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software
                interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical
                distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long
                as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object
                code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by
                this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more
                than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
                Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with
                a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only
                occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
                with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a
                charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
                no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
                code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a
                different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided
                you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
                Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
                available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer
                transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are
                being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object
                code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
                in conveying the object code work.</p>

            <p>A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any tangible personal
                property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or
                sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful
                cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, &quot;normally
                used&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
                particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
                the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
                industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the
                product.</p>

            <p>&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or
                other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
                from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the
                continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
                modification has been made.</p>

            <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product,
                and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
                Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
                is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the
                Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the
                ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in
                ROM).</p>

            <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide
                support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or
                for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the
                modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
                protocols for communication across the network.</p>

            <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in
                a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code
                form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

            <p>7. Additional Terms. &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License
                by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the
                entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are
                valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be
                used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without
                regard to the additional permissions.</p>

            <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that
                copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain
                cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered
                work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if
                authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

            <p>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this
                License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that
                material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting
                misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be
                marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity
                purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark
                law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors
                and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
                contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions
                directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered
                &quot;further restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
                part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a
                further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but
                permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the
                terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or
                conveying.</p>

            <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files,
                a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
                applicable terms.</p>

            <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or
                stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.</p>

            <p>8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this
                License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your
                rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section
                11).</p>

            <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is
                reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
                license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
                reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

            <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder
                notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
                violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30
                days after your receipt of the notice.</p>

            <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received
                copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
                reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</p>

            <p>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive
                or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of
                using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing
                other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
                infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
                you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

            <p>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
                automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
                subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
                License.</p>

            <p>An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially
                all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
                work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also
                receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the
                previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor
                in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

            <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
                License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
                granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in
                a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or
                importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

            <p>11. Patents. A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the
                Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor
                version&quot;.</p>

            <p>A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims owned or controlled by the
                contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
                permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims
                that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
                purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
                consistent with the requirements of this License.</p>

            <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's
                essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
                the contents of its contributor version.</p>

            <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express agreement or commitment,
                however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant
                not to sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make
                such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</p>

            <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work
                is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
                available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding
                Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
                particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the
                patent license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have actual knowledge that,
                but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the
                covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have
                reason to believe are valid.</p>

            <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by
                procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the
                covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then
                the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based
                on it.</p>

            <p>A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within the scope of its coverage,
                prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
                specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
                arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make
                payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the
                third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
                patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
                copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
                covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28
                March 2007.</p>

            <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to
                infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

            <p>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
                this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
                this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For
                example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to
                whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to
                refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

            <p>13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision
                of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
                interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an
                opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding
                Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying
                of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by
                version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work
                with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to
                convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
                work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public
                License.</p>

            <p>14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
                the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
                present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

            <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered
                version of the GNU Affero General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have
                the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
                published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU
                Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                Foundation.</p>

            <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public
                License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
                choose that version for the Program.</p>

            <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations
                are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.</p>

            <p>15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
                &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
                THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
                QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST
                OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

            <p>16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
                COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
                TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
                USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
                INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

            <p>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
                above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law
                that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
                unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

Introduction
============

The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
FreeType Project.

This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
FreeType code. (`credits')

We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
encourage you to use the following text:

"""
Portions of this software are copyright © &lt;year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
    """

    Please replace &lt;year> with the value from the FreeType version you
        actually use.


        Legal Terms
        ===========

        0. Definitions
        --------------

        Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
        and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
        distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
        Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
        beta or final release.

        `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
        `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
        code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
        This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
        engine'.

        This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
        FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
        documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
        original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
        If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
        this license, you must contact us to verify this.

        The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
        Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as

            <h3>SIL Open Font License</h3>
            <p>Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>
            <h5>PREAMBLE</h5>

            <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br />
                development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br />
                efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br />
                open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br />
                with others.</p>
            <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br />
                redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br />
                fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br />
                redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br />
                names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br />
                however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br />
                requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br />
                to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
            <h5> DEFINITIONS</h5>

            <p>"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br />
                Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br />
                include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
            <p>"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the<br />
                copyright statement(s).</p>
            <p>"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br />
                distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
            <p>"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br />
                or substituting &mdash; in part or in whole &mdash; any of the components of the<br />
                Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a<br />
                new environment.</p>
            <p>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br />
                writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
            <h5>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS</h5>

            <p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br />
                a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br />
                redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br />
                Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>
            <p>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br />
                in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.</p>
            <p>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br />
                redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br />
                contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br />
                included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br />
                in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br />
                binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>
            <p>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br />
                Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br />
                Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br />
                presented to the users.</p>
            <p>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br />
                Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br />
                Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br />
                Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br />
                permission.</p>
            <p>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br />
                must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br />
                distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br />
                remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br />
                using the Font Software.</p>
            <h5>TERMINATION</h5>

            <p>This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are<br />
                not met.</p>
            <h5>DISCLAIMER</h5>

            <p>THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br />
                EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF<br />

            <blockquote>3.3.  Required Notices.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>You  must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies  You as the Contributor of the Modification.

However,  you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the  Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely  clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify  the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</blockquote>

If You distribute the Covered Software in  Executable form under a different license, You must make it  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are  offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.

            <blockquote>3.6.  Larger Works.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>You  may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other  code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the  Larger Work as a single product.

            <p>4.  Versions of the License.</p>
            <blockquote>4.1.  New Versions.</blockquote>

Each version will be given a  distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no  one other than the license steward has the right to modify this  License.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>4.2.  Effect of New Versions.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>You  may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered  Software available under the terms of the version of the License  under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the  Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software  prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available  under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and  make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of  the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make  the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent  version of the License published by the license steward.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>4.3.  Modified Versions.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>When  You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for  Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of  this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references  to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license  differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the  license contains terms which differ from this License.</blockquote>
            <p>5.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>COVERED  SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; BASIS,  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF  DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR  NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF  THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE  DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER  CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED  HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>6.  TERMINATION.</p>
            <blockquote>6.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.  Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the  termination of this License shall survive.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>6.2.  If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory  judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the  Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim  is referred to as &ldquo;Participant&rdquo;) alleging that the Participant  Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a  Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the  Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then  any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such  Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not  the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2  of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate  prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day  notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your  claim with respect to the Participant Software against such  Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement  with Participant.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>6.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant  alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly  infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license  or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement  litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such  Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in  determining the amount or value of any payment or license.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>6.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end  user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any  distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses  granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.</blockquote>
            <p>7.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>UNDER  NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL  DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED  SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY  PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR  LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR  ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY  SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT  ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>8.  U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The  Covered Software is a &ldquo;commercial item,&rdquo; as that term is defined  in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &ldquo;commercial computer  software&rdquo; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. &sect;  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &ldquo;commercial computer software  documentation&rdquo; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1  through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire  Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.

This License shall be governed by the law of the  jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original  Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides  otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the  jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with  the losing party responsible for costs, including, without  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the  International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

            <h2>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0</h2>

            <p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
                PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
                DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
                AGREEMENT.</p>

            <p><b>1. DEFINITIONS</b></p>

            <p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p>

            <p class="list">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial
                code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
            <p class="list">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
            <p class="list">i) changes to the Program, and</p>
            <p class="list">ii) additions to the Program;</p>
            <p class="list">where such changes and/or additions to the Program
                originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
                Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
                Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
                Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
                Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
                conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
                are not derivative works of the Program.</p>

            <p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes
                the Program.</p>

            <p>&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
                Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
                Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>

            <p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance
                with this Agreement.</p>

            <p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under
                this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>

            <p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b></p>

            <p class="list">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
                Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
                royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
                of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
                Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in
                source code and object code form.</p>

            <p class="list">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
                Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
                royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
                offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
                Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
                license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
                Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
                such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
                by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
                combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
                licensed hereunder.</p>

            <p class="list">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor
                grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances
                are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
                patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
                Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
                any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
                or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
                granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
                secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
                example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
                to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
                that license before distributing the Program.</p>

            <p class="list">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it
                has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
                the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>

            <p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>

            <p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
                form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>

            <p class="list">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
                Agreement; and</p>

            <p class="list">b) its license agreement:</p>

            <p class="list">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors
                all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
                or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
                conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>

            <p class="list">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors
                all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
                incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>

            <p class="list">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
                Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
                party; and</p>

            <p class="list">iv) states that source code for the Program is available
                from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
                reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
                exchange.</p>

            <p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>

            <p class="list">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>

            <p class="list">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each
                copy of the Program.</p>

            <p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
                within the Program.</p>

            <p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
                Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
                Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>

            <p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>

            <p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
                responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
                like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
                the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
                product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
                potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
                includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
                (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
                indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
                against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)
                arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
                party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
                acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
                distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
                obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
                relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
                order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
                the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
                Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
                Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
                Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
                expense.</p>

            <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
                product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
                Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
                claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
                claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
                alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
                defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
                performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
                Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
                must pay those damages.</p>

            <p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>

            <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
                PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
                OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
                OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
                responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
                distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
                exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
                the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
                damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
                interruption of operations.</p>

            <p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>

            <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
                NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
                INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
                WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
                LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
                NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
                DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
                HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

            <p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>

            <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
                applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
                the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
                by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
                extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

            <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
                (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
                Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
                software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
                Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
                date such litigation is filed.</p>

            <p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
                fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
                Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
                after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
                under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
                distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
                Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
                Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>

            <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
                Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
                copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
                Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including
                revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
                Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse
                Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
                assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
                suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
                given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
                Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
                Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
                of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
                Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
                expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
                rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
                this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
                otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
                Agreement are reserved.</p>

            <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
                the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
                to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
                than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its
                rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

    claims:
    (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
    trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,

    Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

    (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or

    sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
    Original Code (or portions thereof).

    (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
    effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
    Original Code under the terms of this License.

    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
    granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
    separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
    by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
    combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

    2.2. Contributor Grant.
    Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
    hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

    (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or

    created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
    unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

    Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
    Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
    Version (or portions of such combination).

    the Covered Code.

    (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
    granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
    Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;

    Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
    by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
    Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
    infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
    that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Application of License.
    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
    Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
    of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
    version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
    License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
    an additional document offering the additional rights described in
    Section 3.5.

    3.2. Availability of Source Code.
    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
    either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
    Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
    Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
    months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
    (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
    has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
    ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
    Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

    3.3. Description of Modifications.
    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
    the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
    the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
    Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
    Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
    Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
    origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
    (a) Third Party Claims.
    If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
    intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
    granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
    Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
    distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
    party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
    know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
    the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
    Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
    Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
    (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
    reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
    Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

    (b) Contributor APIs.
    If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
    interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
    are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
    also include this information in the LEGAL file.

    (c)    Representations.
    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
    Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
    Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
    Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
    this License.

    3.5. Required Notices.
    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
    Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
    Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
    location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
    to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
    You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
    Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
    for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
    rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
    charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
    obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
    may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
    Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
    any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
    offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
    Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
    and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
    the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
    including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
    obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
    in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
    collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
    Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
    Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
    contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
    Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
    rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
    License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
    license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
    from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
    Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
    the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
    terms You offer.

    3.7. Larger Works.
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
    not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
    Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
    must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
    be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
    understand it.

    5. Application of this License.

    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

    6. Versions of the License.

    6.1. New Versions.
    Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
    and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
    will be given a distinguishing version number.

    6.2. Effect of New Versions.
    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
    License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
    version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
    of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
    other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
    Covered Code created under this License.

    6.3. Derivative Works.
    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
    only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
    governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
    the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
    "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
    license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
    and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
    contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
    Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
    Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
    Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
    this License.)

    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
    DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
    IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
    YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
    COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
    OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
    ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

    8. TERMINATION.

    8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
    such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
    sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
    survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
    nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
    shall survive.

    8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
    claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
    or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
    You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

    (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
    Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
    unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
    agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
    royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
    Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
    the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
    of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
    mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
    is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
    the 60 day notice period specified above.

    (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
    Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
    any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
    and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
    sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
    Participant.

    8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
    alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
    by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
    license.

    8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
    all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
    which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
    prior to termination shall survive termination.

    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
    OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
    ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
    CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
    WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
    EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
    THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
    48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
    software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
    terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
    C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
    all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
    rights set forth herein.

    11. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
    California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
    With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
    or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
    States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
    subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
    District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
    California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
    without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
    expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
    shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
    License.

    12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

    13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
    "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
    Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
    by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.</p>
            <h3 id="distribution-of-executable-form">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</h3>

                <li><p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section&nbsp;3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p></li>
                <li><p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p></li>

            <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>
            <h3 id="notices">3.4. Notices</h3>
            <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>

            <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</p>

            <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
            <h2 id="termination">5. Termination</h2>
            <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p>
            <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section&nbsp;2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
            <p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections&nbsp;5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.</em></p>

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</em></p>
            <h2 id="litigation">8. Litigation</h2>
            <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
            <h2 id="miscellaneous">9. Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            <h3> The Academic Free License v.2.1 </h3>
            <p>This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">     Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
            </p>
            <p>1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">     a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
                <br>
                b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;
                <br>
                c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;
                <br>
                d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
                <br>
                e) to display the Original Work publicly.
            </p>
            <p>2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.
            </p>
            <p>3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
            </p>
            <p>4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
            </p>
            <p>5) This section intentionally omitted.
            </p>
            <p>6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.
            </p>
            <p>7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.
            </p>
            <p>8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
            </p>
            <p> 9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.
            </p>
            <p>10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.
            </p>
            <p>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
            </p>
            <p>12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
            </p>
            <p>13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
            </p>
            <p>14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
            </p>
            <p>15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
            </p>
